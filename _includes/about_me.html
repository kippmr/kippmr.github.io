          I am a full-stack software developer from McMaster University with almost two years of professional experience using an Angular, C# .NET, Oracle PL/SQL stack with Azure user authentication and agile project management with JIRA.
        <p>
          I find myself working my best when I understand what problem I am trying to solve and keeping the end-game in mind along the way. As such, I consider keeping regular communications with clients and other developers a priority to ensure expectations are met and what is thought of current progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am always interested in expanding my knowledge of technologies in this rapidly changing industry.
