					I am a full-stack software developer from McMaster University with almost two years of professional experience
					using an Angular, C# .NET, Oracle PL/SQL stack with Azure user authentication and agile project management with
					JIRA.
				</p>
				<p>
					I find myself working my best when I understand what problem I am trying to solve and keeping the end-game in
					mind along the way. As such, I consider keeping regular communications with clients and other developers a
					priority to ensure expectations are met and what is thought of current progress.
				</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					I am always interested in expanding my knowledge of technologies in this rapidly changing industry.
